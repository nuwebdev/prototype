## Goals:
- The goals for this project can be found in my Proposal file, specifically the 'Project Goal' section. [Link to proposal](proposal/proposal.md)

## Plan:
- The plan for this project can be found in my plan.md file, with prioritized goals for each iteration of the project outlined and tagged. [Link to plan](proposal/plan.md)

## Design Decisions:
- Decisions about the overall user interface and design can be found within [proposal.md] (proposal/proposal.md), specifically within the 'UI Design' block.

## Accomplishments:
- I successfully accomplished all of the Project Goals as laid out in my initial proposal. The only goal I did not achieve was a stretch goal which related to linking the website to a Google Chrome plugin. However, I do intend to keep working on this code and connecting the Chrome plugin user/ comments databases so that they work in concert with one another.
- I've been wanting to create something like this for a long time and I'm thrilled to have been able to do it as part of a project for class.

## Lessons Learned: 
- I am proud to say I was able to accomplish the goals I laid out for this projct. Using the Flask blog tutorial was a strong foundation from which to build this site and offered some streamlining in terms of routing between front and backend. 
- I like the mix of Python/ Flask/ SQLite as I find they work well together and Python is my preferred language. The SQLite databases are relatively straightforward to setup. 
- I do think I could have spent more time reviewing Bootstrap options and aiming to minimize custom CSS included in favor of the proven templates that Bootstrap offers. 
- I do feel I scoped the project appropriately, though I think I should have alloted more time for improving the user interface to look a bit more modern, even if I was going for a basic layout. 
- The most compelling part of my project is that I created something which does not exist on the internet as far as I know. I believe there is a demand/ interest in people having a social experience around house listings, and I now have the foundation from which I can build out this site and launch it to the world. 
- The most challenging part of my project was managing the databases and need to re-initialize the databases such that new Python functions and search and voting functionality worked without issues. I need to learn more about Drop Tables and how to minimize the need for re-initializing each time.
